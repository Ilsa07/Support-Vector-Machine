# Support Vector Machine
This project illustrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to perform binary classification on linearly separable data. SVMS are a popular Supervised Learning method and with the use of a Kernel Trick can also be used to classify non linearly separable datasets. The kernel is the function computig the similarities between two datapoints and it can be used to map the data into feature space, where classes can become linearly separable. In this example a costum dataset is imported and an SVM is trained and evaluated. The final plot shows the two classes in the dataset, the support vectors used in the algorithm and the decision function.


## Getting Started
1. Clone the project and create a virtual environment
2. Install the required packages in the virtual environment
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
